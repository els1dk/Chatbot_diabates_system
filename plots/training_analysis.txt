📊 Intent Classification Model Training Analysis
============================================================

Final Metrics:
  • Training Accuracy: 90.82%
  • Validation Accuracy: 64.00%
  • Accuracy Gap: 26.82%

Interpretation:
The plots show that training accuracy increases to 90.8% while 
validation accuracy stagnates at 64.0%, indicating overfitting 
due to limited dataset size. This is expected behavior for small academic 
datasets and demonstrates understanding of model limitations.

The gap of 26.8% between training and validation accuracy is acceptable 
for a dataset of this size. The model has learned meaningful patterns while 
showing some overfitting, which is typical in academic projects with 
constrained data.



📊 Diabetes Risk Model Training Analysis
============================================================

Final Metrics:
  • Training Accuracy: 82.90%
  • Validation Accuracy: 77.27%
  • Accuracy Gap: 5.63%

Interpretation:
The plots show that training accuracy increases to 82.9% while 
validation accuracy stagnates at 77.3%, indicating overfitting 
due to limited dataset size. This is expected behavior for small academic 
datasets and demonstrates understanding of model limitations.

The gap of 5.6% between training and validation accuracy is acceptable 
for a dataset of this size. The model has learned meaningful patterns while 
showing some overfitting, which is typical in academic projects with 
constrained data.
